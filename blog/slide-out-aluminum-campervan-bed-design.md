Since publishing the video above, I have received numerous asks for more details on the design of the bed I built out of
80/20 aluminum T-slot for my campervan. Although specifically designed for a Mitsubishi Delica, this design can be
generalized for most campers by tweaking the dimensions and mounting points. In this post, I share some insights into
the whole process and cover common questions. You can also purchase the SketchUp file (.skp) and the full parts list of
my build [here](https://alihaghani.gumroad.com/l/slide-out-aluminum-campervan-bed).

#### Why a slide-out design?

A slide-out design allows a bed to wear many hats, maximizing usage of the limited space available in campers. However,
it's not the only multi-hat-wearing design out there. A rock and roll bed was also a contender. The slide-out design won
over because of its simplicity and better alignment with the configuration I had in mind for the van.

#### Why 80/20 aluminum?

At the time, I didn't trust my woodworking skills enough to build the camper's centrepiece out of wood and have it come
out looking good. Building with 80/20 seemed pretty straightforward: you order the pieces to the exact millimeter length
and assemble themâ€“seemingly low effort for a professional-looking end product. Its strength also made for a simpler
design with fewer support pieces. Using the [deflection calculator](https://8020.net/deflection-calculator), I decided
on the 1" profile.

Perhaps the biggest drawback to 80/20 aluminum is its cost. Building this bed ended up costing me more than any
residential bed I'd purchased prior (though to be fair, most of those were from IKEA). I had heard 80/20 can get pricey
but the reality of this only set in when I received an invoice for the parts I had ordered. Cost was the main reason why
I turned to wood for the shelf/slide-out desk unit I built later on.

#### Test your design

I started the arduous but amusing design process before the van arrived in Canada (you can read more about the import
process [here](https://alihaghani.me/blog/mitsubishi-delica-importing-from-japan/)) using interior dimensions I found on
the internet. However, given it'll take up a significant portion of the interior and function not only as a bed but also
a couch and storage unit (amongst other things), I recommend doing some prototyping of the proposed dimensions inside
your camper before ordering parts.

I ended up having to _shorten_ the legs of mine by 5cm to be able to sit up straight on the 4" thick mattress. A
revision in the other direction would've been much pricier (cutting aluminum is cheaper than ordering 8 new legs).

#### Ordering 80/20 aluminum

Depending on where you live, the availability of these coveted aluminum extrusion pieces can vary. I was in Vancouver
when doing this build and managed to find a local supplier that was about an hour drive away. Most suppliers will cut
the ordered pieces to length (sometimes for a small fee). Do some calling around in your area and compare availability
and pricing with online options such as [8020.net](https://8020.net/) and Amazon.
